Assignment 2: Requirements Gathering - Conduct a 30-minute mock interview to gather requirements for a fictional app that helps organize community events. 
Summarize the requirements and how you would document and trace them in a one-page brief.

Solution:

Mock Interview Transcript: Requirements Gathering for Community Events Food Delivery App:

Interviewer (You):** Good morning! Thank you for joining me today. Let's start by discussing your involvement in community events and how food delivery plays a role.

**Interviewee (Fictional Community Events Organizer):** Hi! I'm excited to be here. In our community events, food plays a significant role. We often host festivals, picnics, and fundraisers where attendees expect a variety of food options.

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a wonderful community engagement opportunity. What challenges do you face regarding food logistics during these events?

**Interviewee:** One challenge is ensuring that we have a diverse range of food vendors available to cater to different tastes and dietary preferences. Coordinating with vendors, managing orders, and ensuring timely delivery can be quite hectic.

**Interviewer:** Understood. So, you're looking for a food delivery app tailored to the needs of community events. Can you outline the specific features you're envisioning?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. Firstly, we need a platform where event organizers can browse and select from a curated list of food vendors. The app should allow vendors to showcase their menus, availability, and pricing.

**Interviewer:** Great. Let's break that down further. For event organizers, what functionalities would be essential in the app?

**Interviewee:** Event organizers should be able to:
1. Browse and search for food vendors by cuisine type and availability.
2. View vendor profiles with menus, pricing, and reviews.
3. Place orders for catering services directly through the app.
4. Track order statuses and delivery schedules in real-time.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. Now, for the food vendors themselves, what capabilities would they require?

**Interviewee:** Vendors should be able to:
1. Create profiles with detailed information about their offerings.
2. Manage their menus, availability, and pricing.
3. Receive and manage orders placed by event organizers.
4. Communicate with organizers regarding order details and logistics.

**Interviewer:** Got it. In terms of logistics and delivery, what considerations should we take into account?

**Interviewee:** Timely delivery is crucial, so the app should include features for:
1. Efficient order dispatch and routing.
2. Real-time tracking of delivery drivers.
3. Coordination between vendors, drivers, and event organizers to ensure smooth operations.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for providing such valuable insights. I'll document these requirements and trace them in a one-page brief for our development team.

Assignment 3: Agile Principles Application - Write a two-paragraph reflection on how the Agile values of individuals and interactions, working solutions, 
and customer collaboration apply to the development of the community event app.

Solution:
In developing the community event app, the Agile principle of valuing individuals and interactions resonates deeply. Recognizing that software development is 
ultimately a human endeavor, our team prioritizes open communication, collaboration, and trust among all stakeholders. By fostering a culture where team members 
feel empowered to voice their ideas, concerns, and feedback, we can harness the collective intelligence and creativity of our diverse team. Regular stand-up meetings,
 brainstorming sessions, and continuous feedback loops ensure that everyone is aligned towards the common goal of delivering a high-quality app that meets the needs
 of our community event organizers and attendees.

Moreover, the Agile principle of delivering working solutions iteratively reinforces our commitment to providing tangible value at every stage of development. 
Rather than waiting until the end of a lengthy development cycle to unveil the final product, we adopt an incremental approach, releasing minimum viable features 
early and often. This allows us to gather real-world feedback from users, adapt to changing requirements, and prioritize development efforts based on customer needs. 
By delivering incremental updates, we can validate assumptions, mitigate risks, and incrementally refine the app to ensure that it evolves in alignment with the 
evolving needs of our community. Through close collaboration with our customers, we strive to co-create a community event app that truly adds value and enhances the
 event organizing experience.

Assignment 4: Scrum Framework Overview - Prepare a one-page cheat sheet on the Scrum framework that includes roles, responsibilities, artifacts, and ceremonies. 
Provide a brief example of a Sprint task list for the earlier mentioned app project.

Solution:

Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient
 project delivery. Much like a sports team practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change. 
Software teams use Scrum to solve complex problems cost effectively and sustainably. 

Scrum Framework Cheat Sheet

Roles:

Product Owner: Represents stakeholders, prioritizes backlog items, and ensures the team delivers value.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and fosters a collaborative team environment.
Development Team: Self-organizing group responsible for delivering increments of working product.

Responsibilities:

Product Owner: Defines product vision, creates and maintains the product backlog, and accepts or rejects completed work.
Scrum Master: Coaches the team on Scrum principles, facilitates meetings, and shields the team from external distractions.
Development Team: Estimates tasks, selects work for the sprint, collaborates on solutions, and delivers a potentially shippable product increment.

Artifacts:

Product Backlog: Prioritized list of all desired features, enhancements, and fixes for the product.
Sprint Backlog: Subset of the product backlog items selected for the sprint, along with tasks and commitments.
Increment: The sum of all product backlog items completed during a sprint, potentially shippable and ready for review.

Ceremonies:

Sprint Planning: Collaboratively plans the work to be done in the sprint, including selecting backlog items and defining tasks.
Daily Stand-up: Brief daily meeting where team members synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify any impediments.
Sprint Review: Demo of the completed work from the sprint, gathering feedback from stakeholders.
Sprint Retrospective: Reflective meeting where the team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and actions for the next sprint.
