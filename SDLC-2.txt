Assignment 2: Daily Standup Simulation - Write a script for a Daily Standup meeting for a development team working on the software feature from Assignment 1. 
Address a common challenge and incorporate a solution into the communication flow.

Solution:
**Daily Standup Meeting Script**

**Facilitator:** Good morning, team! Let's begin our daily standup meeting. As usual, let's go around and share our updates and any blockers we're facing. I'll start.

**Facilitator:** Yesterday, I worked on implementing the user authentication feature for the event app. I encountered a challenge with integrating the 
authentication library, but managed to resolve it with some assistance from our backend developer. Today, I'll be focusing on writing unit tests for the authentication
 module.

**Developer 1:** Thanks, [Facilitator]. Yesterday, I continued working on designing the event scheduling interface. I faced a roadblock when trying to finalize the 
layout for mobile devices. However, I reached out to our UI/UX designer, and we collaborated to come up with a solution. Today, I'll be refining the design and 
starting to code the frontend functionality.

**Developer 2:** Hi everyone. Yesterday, I started developing the database schema for storing event data. I ran into an issue with setting up the database migrations,
 but after some troubleshooting and guidance from [Facilitator], I was able to fix it. Today, I'll be completing the database setup and moving on to creating API 
endpoints for managing event details.

**Facilitator:** Thank you for the updates. It's great to see collaboration in overcoming challenges. Now, let's address the common challenge we've been encountering 
with ensuring consistent communication between frontend and backend development teams. To tackle this, let's schedule a brief sync-up meeting at midday where both 
teams can discuss progress, share insights, and address any integration issues promptly. This will help us stay aligned and minimize delays in feature development.

**Developer 1:** That sounds like a good plan. Having a dedicated time slot for cross-team communication will definitely help us streamline our workflow and address
 any issues early on.

**Developer 2:** Agreed. It's important for both teams to have a clear understanding of each other's progress and dependencies. I think the midday sync-up meeting
 will be beneficial for improving collaboration and reducing bottlenecks.

**Facilitator:** Excellent. I'll coordinate with both teams to schedule the midday sync-up meeting starting from tomorrow. Let's ensure we make the most out of this 
opportunity to enhance our communication and accelerate our progress. 

**Developer 1:** Just a reminder to keep the lines of communication open. If anyone encounters any blockers or needs assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the 
team for support.

**Developer 2:** Absolutely. Let's continue to support each other and work together towards achieving our sprint goals.

**Facilitator:** Well said. Thank you, everyone, for your contributions and collaboration. Let's have a productive day! If there are no further questions, 
we can adjourn the meeting.

**Team:** Thank you. Have a great day!

**Facilitator:** Meeting adjourned.
